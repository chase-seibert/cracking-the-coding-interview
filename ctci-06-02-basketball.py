"""
You either have to make 1 shot, or make 2/3. Which game would you pick for a
given shooting probability?

Completion time: 25 minutes.

Notes
- Got the right answer, but backed into it.
- Wrote out all posibilities for 2/3 and 50% shooting.
- Turns out it's 50% making 2/3 or 3/3 at 50% shooting, so I figured that
  was the break point.
- Intuition - 99%, better off with 1 shot.
- IMPORTANT: Probability of 2/3 is p*p*(1-p), 3/3 is p^3

"""
With a 5 unit jug and a 3 unit jug, measure 4 units.

Completion time: 20 minutes.

Notes
- Knew I could diff the two.
- Got to 2/3 in the small jug and came up with a creative hack to remember the
  high water mark and fill it again.
- Correct solution is to diff again, and you get 4 in the larger jug.
